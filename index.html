            <p>Hello and welcome to my website. My name is Nico and I like to play sports such as tennis and rugby and I also like playing video games. I am 15 years old and go to NOVA school in Skopje, Macedonia. I like to hang out with my friends and have a good time. My favortie subjects in school are Math and Computer science. My favorite show is Naruto.</p>  
            <p>The projects that you will be seeing in this website are focused around community service and where both done in Ethiopia. I enjoy doing these types of projects because they help the community and people that do not get the same opportunity that I do.</p>

            <p> The place that I did a project is an orphanage in Ethiopia called Sele Enat Orphanage. In this orphanage they have 20 kids in which half of them are special-needs children. The special needs children are kids that are unable to take care of them selfs because of a phisical or mental health problem. They have many nannys to take care of the kids their and all kids have some form of education. I had a very nice experience woring with Sele Enat and if I had the opportunity I would work with them again. </p>
