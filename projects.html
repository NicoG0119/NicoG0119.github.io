        <h2>Education enhancement at Sele Enat</h2>

        <p>This project was completed by me and three friends as part of a class project. During this project we went to sele Enat and found out that their education program could do with some help. We found out that the kids there did not have many notebooks to write in and that they needed extra teachers. Our group then went and over the course of the next few weeks collected recycled paper and stapled them to make booklets for them to write in. Since we couldnt help them by getting teachers we decided to make some flash cards for the kids with words on them and some multiplication tables so that the teachers could have more time to explain harder problems. As an added bonus we donated two laptops to the orphanage with educational programs on them so the kids could work without teachers.</p>

              <p>I did this project alone as part of my Eagle Scout Final Project. For this project the orphanage said that they had alot of costs related to food becasue they where feeding alot of kids and nannies. As a solution I suggested that i could build them a raised bed garden for them to plant some of their own food. The project took 5 weeks to complete and I built a raised bed garden in the orphanage and taught the kids in the orphanage how to plant and take care of the garden. </p>
